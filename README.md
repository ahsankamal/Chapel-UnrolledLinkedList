# Chapel-UnrolledLinkedList

I have implemented append and pop procedure for inserting and deleting elements repectively at the end of the Unrolled linked list.

My goal was to learn the chapel programming language by implementing a data structure and contribute to the project "Sequential Data Structures" of GSoC 2020. 
I am looking forward to your suggestions and feedback.
